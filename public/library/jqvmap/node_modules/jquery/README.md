Contribution Guides
--------------------------------------

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](http://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects](http://contribute.jquery.org/code/)


Environments in which to use jQuery
--------------------------------------

- [Browser support](http://jquery.com/browser-support/) differs between the master (2.x) branch and the 1.x-master branch. Specifically, 2.x does not support legacy browsers such as IE6-8. The jQuery team continues to provide support for legacy browsers on the 1.x-master branch. Use the latest 1.x release if support for those browsers is required. See [browser support](http://jquery.com/browser-support/) for more info.
